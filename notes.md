## Rag database

#original text
#text splitter
#chunks of text
#embeddings

#Query -> Vector Database -> Response 

## Vector Database
- indexes and stores vector embeddings for fast retrieval and similarity search

Unstructured Data -> Model -> Vector Embedding [0.1,0.2,0.3]

# Use cases
1. long term memory for LLms
2. Semantic Search: searched based on the meaning or context (understanding exactly what is being written down., possibly expanding upon it)
3. similarity search for text, images, audio or video data -> 
maybe also find other similar elements in the document and clump them tohgether with pages
4. reccomendation engine
